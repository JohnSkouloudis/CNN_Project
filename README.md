## Introduction
This project is part of the Machine Learning course, focusing on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for classifying chest X-ray images. The dataset used contains images classified into different categories, and multiple models are trained to evaluate performance.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of chest X-ray images categorized as:
- Normal
- Bacterial Pneumonia
- Viral Pneumonia
- COVID-19

The dataset is loaded and preprocessed using a custom PyTorch `Dataset` class.

## Project Structure
- **COVID19dataset.py** â€“ Contains `COVID19Dataset` class and Task 1  
- **test_train_functions.py** â€“ Includes `train_one_epoch`, `test`, `confusion_matrix`, and `display_confusion_matrix`  
- **CNN1.py** â€“ Implements CNN1 and Task 2  
- **CNN2.py** â€“ Implements CNN2 and Task 3  
- **ResNet50.py** â€“ Implements Task 4 using ResNet50  
- **BasicBlock.py** â€“ Implements the bonus task  
- **README.md** â€“ This file

## Tasks Overview

### Task 1: Dataset Exploration
- **File:** `COVID19dataset.py`
- Implements the `COVID19Dataset` class.
- Generates a bar chart showing class distribution.
- Uses `display_batch` to visualize sample images.
- **Observation:** The dataset is imbalanced, with "Normal" images dominating.

### Task 2: Training a Simple CNN (CNN1)
- **File:** `CNN1.py`
- A basic CNN model is implemented and trained for 20 epochs (with early stopping).
- **Results:** The model is relatively good at detecting "Viral Pneumonia" but has moderate accuracy for other classes. False positives are present, which can be problematic in clinical settings.

### Task 3: Training a Deeper CNN (CNN2)
- **File:** `CNN2.py`
- A deeper CNN architecture is implemented.
- **Comparison with CNN1:** CNN2 achieves higher accuracy than CNN1 due to its increased depth and filter count, enabling better feature extraction.

### Task 4: Transfer Learning with ResNet50
- **File:** `ResNet50.py`
- Fine-tunes a pre-trained ResNet50 model.
- **Training Duration:** ResNet50 took approximately 4.7 hours to train.
- **Additional Experiment:** The last classification layer was trained separately.

### Bonus Task: Implementing a Custom BasicBlock
- **File:** `BasicBlock.py`
- A custom `BasicBlock` module is implemented, similar to ResNet blocks.
